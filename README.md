My solutions to codember challenges done in TypeScript. [Codember](https://codember.dev/) is a programming game and challenge held in the month of November for the [midudev](https://midu.dev/) community. Each week a challenge is posted that must be solved using ingenuity and programming.

## How does it work?

Each week a challenge is published that must be solved using ingenuity and programming. Each challenge has an explanation of the problem, hints and instructions on how to solve it.

## How to participate?

To participate, log in to codember.dev with your GitHub account and use the terminal to start the challenge. Use the help command if you don't know where to start.

## How is it evaluated?

You get a score depending on how long it takes you to solve the challenge since it was published.
